# 06 Mitsuzen HDI-10

## Task Overview

> Read a value from the nerve connected to your central nervous system (CNS) and make your heart beat by writing a sequence of values to your sinoatrial (SA-N) and atrioventricular (AV-N) nodes as indicated in the HDI-10 I/O log when holding the "SHOW GOAL" button. The length of each sequence of values should be equal to the value from the CNS divided by -10. Repeat _ad infinitum_.
>
> It is not necessary to leave no trace. Your EXAs should be written to operate indefinitely.
