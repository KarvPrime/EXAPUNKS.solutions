> The year is 1997. You used to be a hacker, but now you have the phage. You made a deal: one hack, one dose. There’s nothing left to lose… except your life.

## My Approach

This game has 3 metrics to measure your solution: **cycles**, **size**, and **activity**. I'll aim to get in to the `TOP_PERCENTILE` score in each category using the same codebase. This, however, may be impossible to achieve. Therefore, I am including a folder for each metric with a solution in each focusing on that objective alone.

Each solution folder with have a README with the following information:

-   Puzzle Title
-   Puzzle Description
-   Recorded .GIF Solution
-   Link to each metric's solution

If I can complete the task using the same codebase, I will mark the solution as Optimal.

### The Metrics

Below are the definitions for the metrics, as far as the game is considered.

#### Cycles

Your cycles score is the number of turns it takes your EXA to complete the task.

#### Size

Your size score is the total number of instructions in all of your EXAs, including `MARK` pseudo-instructions.

#### Activity

Your activity score is the number of times EXAs you control execute `LINK` or `KILL` instructions.
